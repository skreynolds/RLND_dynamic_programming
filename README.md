# RLND Dynamic Programming

Practical implementation of of dynamic programming for a toy problem in OpenAI gym called Frozen Lake.

This practical assignment consists of 6 parts:

1. Iterative policy evaluation
2. Determining $$q_{\pi}$$ from $$v_{\pi}$$
3. Policy improvement
4. Policy iteration
5. Truncated policy iteration
6. Value iteration

The main file where implementations are found is the `Dynamic_Programming.ipynb` file, which is run on a Juypter Notebook.
